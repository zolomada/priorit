# Project Title

Priorit

## Overview

Priorit is a simple App to prioritize and track your goals (Annual Goals) by breaking it into quaterly goals.

### Problem

Every year we set New Year Resolutions or Annual goals that are usually not achieved because we list down so many things we want to achieve within the year. The goal of the App is to force users to think deeply about their goals and select only 4 major goals for the year. These goals are then set up as "Major Quarterly" goals. Each Quarterly goal will be linked to 3 or 4 "Minor" goals that relate to achieving the "Major" goal.

The Quaterly goals can be independent or they can all be goals that lead up to one "Major Annual" goal.

### User Profile

- Anyone who set goals for the year but never achieves it
- Anyone who would like to set goals but doesn't have a way to track it properly

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
